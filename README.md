# README

In this project, I worked on the Titanic dataset to create a basic data preprocessing and prediction pipeline using logistic regression. I learned about various data preprocessing techniques and used them to prepare the data for training the model. Let's discuss the key steps and the insights gained from the output graphs.

## Dependencies
Before running this script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `warnings`

## Usage
1. First, ensure that the Titanic dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) are in the correct location. If needed, modify the file paths in the script (`../input/titanic/train.csv` and `../input/titanic/test.csv`) to match the actual location of the files on your system.

2. Run the script. It will execute the following steps:

   a. Import the necessary libraries
   
   b. Read the training and test datasets
   
   c. Perform basic data exploration and preprocessing:
   
      - Display information about the datasets
      
      - Show summary statistics of the datasets
      
      - Check for missing values
      
      - Remove unnecessary columns
      
      - Fill missing values with appropriate values
      
      - Display value counts for categorical variables
      
      - Visualize some variables using count plots and box plots
      
      - Handle outliers in the data
      
      - Perform one-hot encoding on categorical variables
      
      - Split the training data into features (`X_train`) and target (`y_train`)
      
      - Apply feature scaling using `StandardScaler` on selected features
   
   d. Train a logistic regression model on the training data
   
   e. Generate predictions for the test data
   
   f. Output the accuracy score of the trained model on the training data
   
   g. Create a submission file (`titanic predictions.csv`) containing the passenger IDs and corresponding survival predictions for the test data

3. The generated submission file can be used to submit predictions to a competition or further analyzed.

## Insights from Output Graphs

Throughout the data exploration and visualization process, I gained valuable insights into the Titanic dataset. Here are some key observations from the output graphs:

- **Survival Count:** The count plot of the `Survived` variable showed that the majority of passengers did not survive the Titanic disaster, indicating an imbalanced dataset.

- **Survival by Gender:** The count plot of `Survived` with `Sex` as the hue revealed that a higher proportion of females survived compared to males. Gender appears to be a significant factor in survival.

- **Survival by Passenger Class:** The count plot of `Survived` with `Pclass` as the hue demonstrated that passengers in first class had a better chance of survival than those in second and third class. The passenger class seems to be correlated with survival.

- **Age Distribution by Survival:** The box plot of `Age` with `Survived` as the hue showed that younger passengers, particularly females, had a higher chance of survival. The age variable is likely to be an important predictor.

- **Fare Distribution by Passenger Class:** The box plot of `Fare` with `Pclass` as the hue indicated that higher fares were generally associated with first-class passengers. Fare could be a useful feature in predicting passenger class.

- **Gender Distribution in Test Data:** The count plot of `Sex` in the test data showed a similar gender distribution as in the training data. This suggests that the model trained on the training data can be applied to make predictions on the test data.

The output graphs provided valuable visualizations of the data, helping to understand the relationships between variables and their impact on survival. These insights were taken into account during the data preprocessing and modeling stages to create a more accurate prediction model.
